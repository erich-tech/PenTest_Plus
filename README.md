# Overview
[CompTIA PenTest+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/pentest) is a certification for cybersecurity professionals tasked with penetration testing and vulnerability assessment and management.
CompTIA PenTest+ is an intermediate-skills level cybersecurity certification that focuses on offensive skills through pen testing and vulnerability assessment. Cybersecurity professionals with CompTIA PenTest+ know how plan, scope, and manage weaknesses, not just exploit them.

This repository provides notes that I've constructed while studying for the PenTest+ exam. These notes are designed to be supplementary study material. This repository is in no way affiliated with CompTIA or Pearson VUE and makes no guarantees of accuracy or completeness.
