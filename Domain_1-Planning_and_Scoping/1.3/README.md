# 1.3 - Given a scenario, demonstrate an ethical hacking mindset by maintaining professionalism and integrity.

## Background checks (of your pentesting team):
* Verify the legal past of your pentesting team. This demonstrates to clients that your pentest group has performed due-diligence, and has validated the integrity of your pentesters (encourages trust).

## Adhere to specific scope of engagement:
* ***Scope*** -- Boundaries for what we are to do (or not do). Stay within the lines. If the scope needs to be changed, you should go through the proper channels.
	* Ex. if a pentester could notice an out-of-scope vulnerability that could be exploited/tested. Verify whether the scope documentation can be changed. You MUST ask for permission first.

* ***Scope Creep*** -- This occurs when additional tasks or activities are added to the pentest project and exceed the original SoW expectations. This can negatively affect the overall schedule or delivery of the final pentest report. 

## Report concerning activity to your client:
* While you’re doing an engagement, you may notice odd network activity (or possible nefarious individuals). While PenTesters may ‘act’ as threats, they are there to help protect the client. 
	* Common evidence of threats/hacking → Malware; connections to C2 servers; automated tasks; backdoors; Data exfiltration.

* ***Identify criminal activity*** -- PenTesters put themselves in situations where they may notice malicious/criminal activity (in person or digitally).
	* Ex. viewing a worker doing odd things → plugging in USB into a server (possible insider threat).
	* Logs may show evidence of malware traffic or IoC.
* ***Report breaches/criminal activity*** -- IMMEDIATELY report breaches and/or criminal activity to your client.

## Maintain confidentiality (of client data/information)
* You’ll see confidential information while pentesting. Be cautious of your movements to avoid accessing/exposing any client data. 
	* Ex. If you believe that your hack may mistakenly expose confidential info, relay this to PoC/client.
* Be cautious before, during, and after an engagement. 
	* After the PenTest, you could still mistakenly violate confidentiality → Don’t share pentest findings with friends or family. This is a breach of confidentiality. 


## Limit - Tools & Invasiveness
* You're there for the customer → Your goal should be to give them a positive experience, while also avoiding causing any downtime. We only do what we NEED to do (to prove that there is a security issue). 
	* Prove that you can gain access to certain information → BUT don’t actually expose the data.
* ***Limit the use of tools*** (to a particular engagement) -- Only approved/appropriate tools. Don’t use tools that could cause business issues.
	* Utilizing weaker tools may take you longer to perform your steps, but it helps avoid the possibility of causing outages. 
* ***Limit invasiveness*** (based on scope) -- 
	* Limit your movements → You're not there to root through EVERY box.
	* Tread lightly, and only do what you’re there to do.
