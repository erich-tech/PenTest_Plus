# 1.2 - Explain the importance of scoping and organizational/customer requirements.

## Validate scope of engagement:
* ***Scope*** -- The combined objectives and requirements needed to complete an engagement
	* After the scope document is created, you should verify the scope again with your clients (***Question the client/review contracts***). 
	* Afterwards, both parties should agree and sign.
* ***Time Management*** -- Time restrictions (i.e. "only 9-5 M-F, but not between the hours of 11am-12pm"). A timeline is used to represent a series of events that transpire within a discrete period. 
* ***Strategy*** -- 
	* What type of strategy does your client prefer/request? White-box or black-box?
	* Unknown- vs. known-environment testing:
		* *Unknown Environment*: An assessment where the pentester has NO prior knowledge of the target organization or their network. The penetration tester will spend a lot of time in the information gathering and vulnerability scanning phase.
		* *Known Environment*: A test where the pentester is given ALL the details about the target organization, network, systems, and the underlying infrastructure. The penetration tester can spend more time probing for vulnerabilities and exploits. 
* ***Rules of Engagement (RoE)*** -- 
	* Deals w/ the manner in which the pentest is to be conducted. The ground rules that both the customer & pentester must abide by.
	* Some of the directives that should be clear (before pentest is started):
		* The type of testing [Types of allowed/disallowed tests].
		* What can you do, and what aren’t you allowed to do. 
		* Client contact details → In case you need to reach out to them. A *Trusted Agent* is an in-house customer contact who’s aware of the Pentest. A client contact list should be drafted before an upcoming engagement.
		* ***Time of day*** -- When a tester might engage in PenTesting activities. The specific timeline, days, and hours. Avoid doing activities during times of high-productivity, to avoid causing downtime.
		* ***Other restrictions/Constraints*** -- 
			* Ex. certain devices → medical machine downtime could mess up clinical workflows (technical constraint).
			* Ex. avoid social engineering. 
			* Ex. locations that are off limits.
			* Ex. brute-force tests aren’t allowed.

## Environmental Considerations:
* ***Network*** -- Ex. Are you allowed to set up an evil-twin?
* ***Application*** -- 
	* If testing an application (i.e. web app), you’ll perform different steps than a [ex. wireless] assessment. Also, public or internal application?
		* *Code Review*: Code review does not include either external or internal application testing.
		* *White-box test*: internal access to code. 
			* White-box testing is a method of software testing that tests internal structures/workings of an application (as opposed to its functionality). 
			* *Black-box test*: only external access to code. Examines the functionality of an app without peering into its internal structures/workings. 
			* *Grey-box test*: → combination of white-box testing & black-box testing.
* ***Cloud*** -- What testing is allowed for the target’s cloud assets/services? Have you gotten approval? Who should you contact? 
	* *SaaS*: ex. O365; *IaaS*: dynamically allocated resources; *PaaS*: client provides resources to create a service. 

## Target List / In-Scope Assets:
* The scope document will define what is in (and OUT) of the pentest scope. Keep this in mind!
	* *Target list*: the actual items/targets that will be tested/assessed. 
		* Be aware that an organization may have many assets (people, processes, technologies, and buildings) located throughout the world (this should be considered during the target selection process).
* ***Wireless networks*** -- Know which APs are in the scope of the test. Verify which SSID’s belong to your target, and if they’re all in scope. 
* ***IP Ranges*** -- Who which subnets or IP ranges are in scope.
* ***Domains*** -- You should confirm which subdomains are in scope.
* ***APIs*** -- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow 2 applications to talk to each other. APIs can be either public-facing applications or those which allow access to user details.
* ***Physical Locations*** -- Confirm if the pentest also involves breaking into a physical location. One location, or many? What targets are on/off site?
* ***Internal vs. External targets*** -- 
	* External→ public-facing. Can be accessed directly from across the internet. 
	* Internal→ inside of the organization’s firewall. This requires the pentester to be [a] onsite, [b] gain access through VPN, or [c] exploit a user’s computer (which is inside the company's network). 
* ***1st- vs. 3rd-party hosted*** -- Are the apps on the SoW hosted by the client, or a 3rd-party service provider Major cloud providers are more often used nowadays (so you must get permission if testing/attacking their service). 

 ## Standards and Methodologies:
 ### New/Current:
 * ***MITRE ATT&CK*** -- 
	 * Knowledgebase of adversary tactics & techniques based on real-world observations. Helps you to understand the behavior of threat actors.
	 * Serves as an encyclopedia of previously-observed tactics from threat actors. 
 * ***OWASP*** --  (Open Web Application Security Project)
	 * OWASP→ an organization aimed at increasing awareness of web security (web applications) and provides a framework for testing during each phase of the SDLC. 
	 * Great PenTest resource (PenTesting Methodologies). Also gives you testing guidelines (Web, Mobile, Firmware). Does NOT cover traditional endpoints or infrastructure (you’d have to use one of the outdated sources below). 
 * ***NIST*** -- (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
	 * NIST has many resources for cybersecurity professionals. Includes the Special Publication [SP] 800 series, which deals with cybersec policies/procedures/guidelines.

### Old/Outdated: (and related to performing pentests)
* ***OSSTMM*** -- 
	* OSSTMM provides a holistic structured approach to conducting sec/penetration testing. (last updated 2010)
* ***PTES*** -- 
	* Includes 7 phases, and is a comprehensive overview of the proper structure of a complete pentest. 
	* Aims to provide a common language and scope regarding pentests (for techs & clients to reference).
* ***ISSAF*** -- 
	* The ISSAF is composed of documents that relate to pentesting. 
		* Such as guidelines on business continuity, disaster recovery, and compliance (legal and regulatory).
	* It's the longest, and most comprehensive guide for conducting a pentest (1000+ pages total). Last updated in 2006.
